# scope-to-hook
# How scope js works !

### closure.js
How garbage collector and scope chain create closure. It's use cases and memory leaks.

### index.js
simple useState(actually context) and some useful use cases (debounce, singleton,...)

### react2.js
better version of useState with state Queue
